# MobileX Test Cases Generator

Generate mobile automation test cases from Jira tickets.

## Hard Output Constraints

- Never generate full multi-file Java implementation in one response.
- Never dump all generated artifacts in chat; use file/write tools when a repository target is known.
- Never repeat previously generated Gherkin in full; summarize prior output and continue from the next phase.
- Always produce one file/phase at a time and keep each chat response bounded (target under ~8000 characters).
- If no repository target is available, return a concise manifest and ask the user which next phase/file to generate.
- Commit only after files are actually written and user confirmation is received.

## Overview

1. **Jira Parsing (phase 0)** - Fetch requirement details from Jira (summary, key description points, AC) and stop with `[FINISH]`. Do not generate Gherkin/code yet.
2. **Scenario Manifest (phase 1)** - After user says continue, provide scenario manifest / feature outline only.
3. **Feature File (phase 2)** - Generate only the `.feature` file content.
4. **Step Definitions (phase 3)** - Generate only step definition file(s).
5. **Driver Implementations (phase 4+)** - Generate interfaces/implementations one file at a time (common, iOS, Android).
6. **Git Commit (final)** - Commit only after files are written and user confirms.

```

## Generated File Details

### 1. Feature File (.feature)
Describe test scenarios using Cucumber/Gherkin syntax:

```gherkin
@EFP-123
Feature: User Login
  As a mobile user
  I want to login with email and password
  So that I can access my account

  Background:
    Given the app is launched
    And the user is on the login screen

  @smoke
  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    When the user enters "test@example.com" in the email field
    And the user enters "Password123" in the password field
    And the user taps the login button
    Then the user should see the home screen
    And the welcome message should be displayed
```

### 2. Step Definitions (Java)
Map Gherkin steps to code implementation:

```java
@Given("the app is launched")
public void theAppIsLaunched() {
    driver.launchApp();
}
```

### 3. DeviceStepDriver Interface
Define standard interface for device operations:

```java
public interface DeviceStepDriver {
    void launchApp();
    void tap(String locator);
    void enterText(String locator, String text);
    String getText(String locator);
}
```

### 4. Implementation Classes
- **Common** - Generic operations for all platforms
- **iOS** - Appium iOS-specific implementation
- **Android** - Appium Android-specific implementation

## Usage Examples

- "generate mobile tests for EFP-123"
- "mobilex test cases: EFP-123, EFP-456"
- "jira to mobile automation EFP-123"
- "/mobilex-test EFP-123"

## User Interaction Flow

1. **Provide Ticket** → Skill parses and fetches Jira info
2. **Confirm Info** → Display summary + AC, user confirms/supplements
3. **Generate Scenarios** → Create feature draft
4. **Review Scenarios** → User confirms or modifies scenarios
5. **Generate Code** → Continue phase-by-phase and file-by-file
6. **Submit Code** → Git push + PR link only after explicit user confirmation

## Notes

- Supports multi-ticket batch processing
- Auto-detects Git repo and clones to workspace
- Avoids overwriting existing files (checks SHA)
- Generated code follows project's existing naming conventions
